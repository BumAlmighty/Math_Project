USAF:
Military and domestic disaster response operations could benefit from a mobile military micro-grids system, in which a secure micro-grid could produce and store power ranging from a 45kWh (5X5X5), 150kWh (5X5X19), 1.2MWh mounted on a 30 trailer and a 2 MWh energy storage device mounted on a 54 trailer.  These mobile energy storage devices would have integrated power electronics and remote monitoring capabilities and could then be deployed to where the power is needed most.  In the event of a military response, power is then supplied via a low noise, low impact or silent campTM method utilizing the regenerative fuel cell, which would then be recharged by any military or non-military generator set or when the main power grid or other micro-grid is reattached.  Multiple energy storage devices could be charged and waiting deployment while others are performing peak shaving, peak shifting and energy arbitrage functions during normal operating conditions.

Army Corp: The objectives for this demonstration are consistent with the Armys sustainable energy and power approach to reducing energy usage as defined by various U.S. energy and environmental policies being championed by the recently formed Army Energy Security Task Force.
Benefits
Improved energy security by: (1) sustaining operations following electric grid failures; (2) increasing tolerance to grid-related interruptions; (3) optimizing availability of energy generated by on-base, intermittent renewable energy resources such as wind and solar; and (4) maintain tight command and control over grid interface, distributed generation resources and critical load priorities.
Accelerated adoption of renewable energy sources by providing intermittent wind and solar resources with plug-and-play energy storage and power conditioning electronics that can make renewable energy available for use regardless of when it is generated.
Reduced use of fossil fuels by: (1) operating on-base backup generators for fewer hours and at much higher efficiencies; (2) reducing or eliminating some fossil fuel burning backup generators, and (3) reduce the logistical tail necessary to supply sustained operations.
Reduced carbon footprint by reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.",1006701
